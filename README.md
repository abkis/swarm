# Swarm

Swarm robotics simulation

End Goal: search and rescue 

Steps:

1. Simple robots (represented by circles, squares, etc). Each robot has specific sensors/capabilities

2. Robots move around environment in simple manner (avoid collisions, change trajectory on collision, etc)

3. Robot communication within specific network (graph optimization? send signal to all in range?)

4. More complex movement

5. Complex terrain

6. Hidden "goal" state to find

7. Transport found item to safety
